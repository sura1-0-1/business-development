## **Section 2: Project Details**

1. **Describe your project in detail**

   1. **What is your problem statement or the opportunity you are targeting?**

      DevPool is the crypto talent marketplace and a model for DAO growth and is built right on-top of GitHub. This means that DevPool has the reach of the entire GitHub development community and all of GitHub's tools. Sitting on top of GitHub,  DevPool uses Ubiquity DAO's in-house algorithms and AI to optimally match talented developers with tasks and projects they are interested in and get paid for their contribution. In turn, this allows projects to dynamically scale based on need and source the right talent to contribute. 

      We want to extend and streamline payments and Gnosis financial tools into each user and project using DevPool starting with the integration of Safe Wallet. 

   2. **How will end users benefit from the solution?**

      Users will have the ability to store, get paid, settle and transact financial tools with Safe as the backbone for their activities. The result is that Safe and Gnosis products will be ubiquitous for all of DevPool's userbase in day-to-day use.

   3. **How does your project solve the problem or capture the white space?**

      DevPool is the marketplace that Crypto is in need of. We are a systematic building catalyst for project growth and a revenue source for contributors. We are a growth engine for the industry based on a builder approach. 
      
      Our next step at Ubiquity DAO with relation to Safe is to launch fiat cash out options including bank transfers and a crypto debit card to further streamline Safe and Gnosis product daily use and market reach.

   4. **How did you come up with this idea?**

As our DAO grew we realized that the decentralized nature of DAOs, like Ubiquity, necessitated a new platform. A marketplace where we can call upon specialized talent, on demand, to help solve our problems. Not only was it a rethink of the hiring process, it was an organic extension to the way DAOs and the future of crypto will work. We soon realized it is also a sustainable model for how DAOs can optimally operate. This is where we embarked on building our first grand contribution to the crypto environment: The DevPool.

The DevPool can be considered both a marketplace and a DAO OS.

**As a marketplace:** DevPool enables DAOs to work smoother and develop faster. DevPool allows contributors to help build both horizontally and vertically based on their interest and get paid for their contributions. It is a marketplace where need meets supply.

**As an OS:** DevPool helps keep DAOs and project managers focused on their mission and deliverables. This is the OS component. Built on top of GitHub and integrating our extensible Ubiquibot AI, DevPool allows project managers to optimize their resources and collaborate with effective, results focused, talent to build and deploy their projects.

Being built on top of GitHub means that DevPool enjoys all the features that are organic to GitHub and by extension it means that we can deploy the best of DAO models to also support existing web2 projects as well as future crypto development on GitHub.

2. **What is the core value proposition of your project? Include details such as competitive analysis, comparables to similar projects and an emphasis on your key differentiators** 
   DevPool has first mover advantage. One could compare it to a Crypto native Upwork from the developer perspective but DevPool is so much more since it harnesses the power of GitHub and supports all the projects therein, DevPool is a talent marketplace, a Growth engine and being Crypto first, it can be utilized as an OS for DAOs to professionally streamline growth and product development.

3. **Does your project use any novel technology?** 

   We have built numerous novel technologies which we have deployed into DevPool including our AI engine which is constantly being upgraded - UbiquiBot. 

4. **What type of support are you looking for?**

   - [x] Funding

   - [x] Introductions to investors

   - [x] Technical support

   - [x] Marketing

   - [x] Advice/Consulting

   - [ ] HR/Hiring

   - [ ] Other

5. **Add additional context here to type of support required**

   We are looking to develop a strategic and long term relationship with the Safe and Gnosis teams.

Active and daily use of Safe modules and products by a very large target audience using Safe 
        and Gnosis products online and off courtesy of Ubiquity DAO and DevPool.
