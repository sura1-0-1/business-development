# Withdraw Liquidity

When your lockup period is complete, you can withdraw your liquidity from the Ubiquity Curve Metapool. Here’s a detailed explanation to guide you through the process:

***

## **1. Prepare Metamask**

To access your withdrawn liquidity, ensure the **uAD token** is added to your Metamask wallet:

### **Steps to Add uAD Token to Metamask:**

#### **1, Open MetaMask**:

Launch your MetaMask extension or mobile app.

#### **2, Navigate to Assets**:

* Click on the **Assets tab** in your MetaMask wallet.

#### **3, Add Custom Token**:

* Scroll down and select **"Import Tokens"**.
* Go to the **Custom Token** tab.

#### **4, Enter Token Details**:

* Input the **Token Contract Address**:\
  `0x0f644658510c95cb46955e55d7ba9dda9e9fbec6`
* MetaMask will automatically populate:
  * **Token Symbol**: `uAD`
  * **Decimals of Precision**: `18`

#### **5, Save the Token**:

* Click **Add Custom Token** to finalize.
* uAD will now appear under your MetaMask wallet's assets.

### **2. Withdraw Liquidity from Curve**

Once you’ve added uAD to MetaMask, you can retrieve your liquidity from Curve:

**Steps to Withdraw Liquidity:**

#### **1, Visit Curve Metapool**:

* Navigate to [Curve](https://crv.to) and search for the uAD pool.

#### **2, Connect Your Wallet**:

* Click **Connect Wallet** and select MetaMask.
* Ensure you're on the Ethereum network.

#### **3, Access Withdrawal Options**:

* Locate the **Withdraw Liquidity** section within the uAD pool interface.

#### **4, Specify Amount**:

* Enter the amount of liquidity you wish to withdraw.
* Curve will calculate and display the uAD and stablecoins (DAI, USDC) you’ll receive.

#### **5, Approve Transaction**:

* Confirm the withdrawal transaction in MetaMask.
* Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain.

***

The withdrawn uAD and stablecoins will appear in your MetaMask wallet once the transaction is finalized. If necessary, refresh your wallet interface to see the updated balances.

### **Important Notes:**

* Ensure your lockup duration has expired before attempting to withdraw staked LP tokens.
* Ethereum transactions require gas fees. Ensure you have sufficient ETH in your wallet to cover these fees.
* Use [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) to track the progress of your withdrawal.
