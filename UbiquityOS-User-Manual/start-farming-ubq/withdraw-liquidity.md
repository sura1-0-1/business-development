# Withdraw Liquidity

When your lockup period is complete, you can withdraw your liquidity from the Ubiquity Curve Metapool. Here’s a detailed explanation to guide you through the process:

***

### **Prepare Metamask**

To access your withdrawn liquidity, ensure the **UUSD token** is added to your Metamask wallet:

### **Steps to Add** UUSD **Token to Metamask**

#### **1, Open MetaMask**

Launch your MetaMask extension or mobile app.

#### **2, Navigate to Assets**

Click on the **Assets tab** in your MetaMask wallet.

#### **3, Add Custom Token**

* Scroll down and select **"Import Tokens"**.
* Go to the **Custom Token** tab.

#### **4, Enter Token Details**

Input the **Token Contract Address**:\
`0x0f644658510c95cb46955e55d7ba9dda9e9fbec6`

MetaMask will automatically populate:

* **Token Symbol**: UUSD
* **Decimals of Precision**: `18`

#### **5, Save the Token**

Click **Add Custom Token** to finalize. **UUSD** will now appear under your MetaMask wallet's assets.

### **Withdraw Liquidity from Curve**

Once you’ve added **UUSD** to MetaMask, you can retrieve your liquidity from Curve:

### **Steps to Withdraw Liquidity:**

#### **1, Visit Curve Metapool**

Navigate to [Curve](https://crv.to) and search for the UUSD pool.

#### **2, Connect Your Wallet**

&#x20;Click on the "Connect Wallet" button, and from the list of available options, select MetaMask as your wallet of choice. Before proceeding, double-check that your MetaMask wallet is set to the Ethereum network, as this is essential for interacting with Ethereum-based applications. Once connected and on the correct network, you'll be able to manage transactions and interact seamlessly with the platform.

#### **3, Access Withdrawal Options**

Locate the **Withdraw Liquidity** section within the UUSD pool interface.

#### **4, Specify Amount**

To withdraw liquidity from Curve, you first need to enter the amount you wish to withdraw. Once you have specified this amount, Curve will automatically calculate and display the distribution of assets you will receive from the liquidity pool withdrawal. This typically includes UUSD and other stablecoins like DAI and USDC, giving you a clear overview of what your withdrawal will comprise based on the current pool ratios.

#### **5, Approve Transaction**

To complete a withdrawal transaction using MetaMask, begin by confirming the transaction within the MetaMask interface. After this step, it's important to wait patiently as the transaction is processed and confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain. This confirmation can take varying amounts of time depending on network congestion and gas fees. Once confirmed, the withdrawal will be successfully executed.

***

The withdrawn UUSD and stablecoins will appear in your MetaMask wallet once the transaction is finalized. If necessary, refresh your wallet interface to see the updated balances.

### **Important Notes**

* Ensure your lockup duration has expired before attempting to withdraw staked LP tokens.
* Ethereum transactions require gas fees. Ensure you have sufficient ETH in your wallet to cover these fees.
* Use [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) to track the progress of your withdrawal.
