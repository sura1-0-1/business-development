# Start Farming UBQ

**Farming UBQ** involves providing liquidity to the Ubiquity ecosystem and staking liquidity provider (LP) tokens to earn **Ubiquity Governance Tokens (UBQ).** Farming UBQ revolves around participating in the Ubiquity ecosystem by **providing liquidity** to its Curve Metapool and then **staking LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens** to earn **Ubiquity Governance Tokens (UBQ)** as rewards.

### **What is Liquidity in DeFi ?**

Liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) ensures that assets can be easily traded without causing significant price fluctuations. This is achieved by users contributing their tokens to **liquidity pools**, which are smart contract-driven reserves that facilitate trades.

* In Ubiquityâ€™s case, users can add stablecoins (like DAI or USDC) to a **Curve Metapool**, which supports the Ubiquity Dollar (UUSD).
* In return, users receive **LP tokens** representing their share of the pool.
