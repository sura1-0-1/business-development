# Providing Liquidity

To begin your journey with Ubiquity, you will need to provide liquidity to the system. We use a Curve Metapool for our primary market. When you provide liquidity, you will be issued liquidity provider (LP) tokens that serve as the proof of your investment.

Before you start, make sure you have some Ether in your Metamask wallet to cover your "gas" fees -the fee to conduct any transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. You can send crypto to your wallet through exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. Nowadays, you can also buy ETH directly on Metamask using Wyre, a financial payment service.

To begin farming UBQ, you need to provide liquidity to the UUSD pool on Curve. Here's how it works:

### **Steps to Provide Liquidity**

### **1, Prepare Your Wallet:**

* Use **Meta Mask** as your wallet and ensure it has ETH for gas fees.
* Transfer or buy ETH using exchanges or MetaMask integrations like Wyre.

### 2, **Access the Curve Metapool:**

Go to the  [Ubiquity Dollar dashboard](http://uad.ubq.fi/) and click the **DEPOSIT** button for UUSD. this redirects you to the Curve Metapool interface, where you can add liquidity. You may also go to [crv.to](http://crv.to/) directly and search for UUSD.

### 3, Add Liquidity:

Connect your **Metamask wallet** to the Curve dApp. Once that is done, you can click the blue droplet (see below) to add liquidity to the UUSD pool. You can use either DAI or USDC. Add in your amount and click add liquidity. Approve your transaction on Metamask.

### 4, Receive LP Tokens

Congratulations! You are now a liquidity provider and will receive LP tokens. It will show up as "uAD3CRV-f" in your Metamask.

When sending or receiving on any network, be patient, as it may take a while to show up in your account. It will eventually show up on here after the transaction has gone through sufficient amounts of confirmations on the blockchain.
