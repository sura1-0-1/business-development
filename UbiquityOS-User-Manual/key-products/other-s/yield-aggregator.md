# Yield Aggregator



The Yield Aggregator is a powerful tool within the Ubiquity ecosystem, designed to offer users enhanced returns by deploying their stablecoins into conservative yield farming strategies. Users can deposit assets like DAI or USDC into the aggregator, with a 10% deposit fee accruing to the UBQ Treasury, which helps build up collateral reserves for Ubiquity Dollar (uAD).

The core advantage of the Yield Aggregator is that users receive double the yield they would get from traditional vault strategies, in the form of uCR tokens. These perpetual debt tokens can be redeemed for uAD once the stablecoin trades above $1. The custom yield strategies used by the aggregator are carefully vetted through Ubiquity governance, ensuring they are safe and efficient.

In addition to offering attractive yields, the Yield Aggregator also benefits the Ubiquity protocol by strengthening its collateral reserves, supporting the partial collateralization of uAD, and enabling wider participation in the DeFi space. For users, it's a simple, fire-and-forget solution to earn competitive stablecoin yields, while for the protocol, it enhances engagement and long-term stability.
