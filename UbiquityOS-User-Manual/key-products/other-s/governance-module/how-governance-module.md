# How Governance Module

The **Governance Module** in the Ubiquity ecosystem is central to enabling decentralized decision-making and managing the lifecycle of proposals.&#x20;

The governance system allows token holders to propose, discuss, vote, and implement changes within the Ubiquity ecosystem. This ensures community-driven development and prioritizes ecosystem health and stability.

Governance within the Ubiquity ecosystem operates across **four distinct phases**, designed to progressively transition from centralized decision-making to full community-driven governance. Each phase serves a specific purpose in **refining**, **implementing**, and **executing proposals** that benefit the ecosystem.

**Four key phases**:

## **1, Rapid Prototyping Period:**

At the very beginning of each product, the Ubiquity team will have full access to **deploy changes** and **hotfixes** to the product as needed.  this will facilitate agile development and rapid iteration at the inception of a product. Furthermore, the core development team will have mint access to [uCR](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar-development/wiki/11.-uCR) tokens to finance these changes.

This stage lasts approximately one month, but this may vary based on the project.

## **2, Cool Off Period**

The Cool Off Period is to introduce community feedback into the decision-making process. During this period, the Ubiquity team will maintain exclusive deployment privileges, ensuring that all proposed changes are subject to a transparent community discussion on the project’s forums. This approach allows for thorough vetting and ensures that the community plays an active role in discussions, providing feedback, and engaging with the initial stages of governance processes.&#x20;

The duration of the Cool Off Period is estimated to be around three months, although there is flexibility to adjust this timeframe based on the project's needs.

## **3, Fully Decentralized Governance**

Fully Decentralized Governance is to transition to a governance model that is entirely driven by the community. Under this model, control lies in the hands of the community, as proposals are created, debated, and executed based on the outcomes of community voting.&#x20;

Voting power within this framework is determined by the staking of UBQ tokens, where staked governance tokens dictate the weight of each vote. Additionally, a duration multiplier is applied, which means that longer staking periods result in greater voting power, following a predefined multiplier curve.&#x20;

**Voting power** is determined by:

**Where**

* UBQ is the number of governance tokens staked in the governance module
* D is a duration multiplier, based on how long the tokens are staked for

The staking duration can range from a minimum of 1 week to a maximum of 208 weeks, allowing participants to have increased influence based on their level of commitment to the governance process.

The process for suggesting and implementing a proposal will closely follow UniSwap’s governance process, with tweaked parameters and an additional **Tender** step.

### **1, Temperature Check**:&#x20;

**T**he purpose of the Temperature Check is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo.

**Create a Temperature Check:**

1. Community member (A) asks a general, non-biased question to the community forum about a potential change (example: “Should uAD rewards for coupon holders be increased by 10%?”).
2. Voters vote on-chain to indicate their interest in bringing it forward to the next stage. Voting lasts 5 days, or until 5% of the voting pool backs the proposal.

If the proposal gains 5% of the pool backing, then it moves to the next stage - consensus check.

### **2, Consensus Check**:&#x20;

The **Consensus Check** stage ensures that a proposed idea, refined by community feedback, is thoroughly discussed and formally voted upon to determine whether it proceeds to the **Tender Process**.

This stage serves to establish formal discussions, creating a structured environment for stakeholders to engage in in-depth conversations about the proposed idea, allowing them to express concerns, share insights, and explore the implications. It also emphasizes the importance of refining proposal details, leveraging feedback from the community to strengthen the proposal, address potential challenges, enhance feasibility, and ensure that key considerations are not overlooked.



### **3, Tender Process**:&#x20;

Opens implementation bids for passed proposals.

### **4, Governance Proposal**:&#x20;

Final implementation and execution of the proposal.



## **4, Governance Proposal Execution**



Each phase progressively decentralizes control, culminating in full community-driven governance.
