# uCR NFT



The **Ubiquity Credit NFT (uCR NFT)** is a critical component of the Ubiquity protocol, designed to maintain the stability of the **Ubiquity Dollar (uAD)** by incentivizing supply contraction during periods of downward price pressure. This mechanism ensures the system's adaptability during volatile debt cycles and sustained stability once the peg to $1.00 is achieved.
