# Tokenomics

## **Ubiquity Tokenomics Overview**

Ubiquity's **Dollar (UUSD)** is a decentralized stablecoin designed to maintain its peg through a combination of **monetary and fiscal policies**. Recognizing the challenges faced by purely algorithmic stablecoins, Ubiquity adopts a hybrid approach, beginning with full collateralization and evolving towards partial collateralization.

## **Key Features of** UUSD **Tokenomics**

### **1. Collateralization Approach**

The collateralization approach begins with a strategy that is fully collateralized to establish a robust and stable foundation during the initial launch phase. As the platform matures, there is a gradual reduction in reliance on collateral, which aims to maintain stability while optimizing capital efficiency.&#x20;

### **2. Collateral Management**

The initial phase of the manual collateral buyback process is managed through the treasury wallet, providing an opportunity to test and refine various aspects of the system. This includes selecting suitable types of collateral, sourcing collateral through the Yield Aggregator, and determining the level of aggressiveness needed for buybacks.&#x20;

Once these processes have been thoroughly validated, buybacks will transition to automation via Transfer Hooks. This shift will occur during Ubiquity Dollar transactions, thereby enhancing both the efficiency and scalability of the buyback mechanism.

## **Ubiquity Ecosystem**

The Ubiquity ecosystem is designed with a modular approach, enabling individual products to function independently while benefiting from **synergies across products**. This ensures that the ecosystem's value grows as more products are integrated.

### **Current Components**

1. **Ubiquity Dollar Protocol**: The foundation of the ecosystem, built around the stability and utility of the UUSD stablecoin.
2. **Yield Aggregator**: A tool to optimize returns, which also plays a key role in collateral sourcing for the Ubiquity Dollar.

### **Shared Ecosystem Elements**

*   **üè¶ Treasury**:

    Acts as the financial backbone, supporting collateral buybacks and funding ecosystem development. Enables sustainable growth and facilitates the transition to partial collateralization.
*   **üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Governance**:

    Oversees decision-making across the ecosystem, transitioning from centralized to community-driven governance in structured phases.

### **Future Products**

The ecosystem is designed to support multiple products, each operating autonomously but benefitting from shared resources such as governance and treasury, creating synergies across the ecosystem.

The **Ubiquity Dollar Protocol** and its supporting ecosystem components are the first steps in building a scalable and resilient platform, demonstrating the potential of hybrid stablecoins in a decentralized financial ecosystem.
