# Tokenomics

## **Ubiquity Tokenomics Overview**

Ubiquity's **Dollar (UUSD)** is a decentralized stablecoin designed to maintain its peg through a combination of **monetary and fiscal policies**. Recognizing the challenges faced by purely algorithmic stablecoins, Ubiquity adopts a hybrid approach, beginning with full collateralization and evolving towards partial collateralization.

## **Key Features of** UUSD **Tokenomics**

### **1. Collateralization Approach**

* Fully collateralized to provide a strong foundation and ensure stability during the launch phase.
* Gradual reduction in collateral reliance, ensuring stability while optimizing capital efficiency.
* Focus on **permissionless, pegged stablecoins** such as **LUSD**, which align with the decentralized ethos.

### **2. Collateral Management**

* **Manual Collateral Buyback**: Initially managed via the treasury wallet, allowing for:
  * Testing and refining processes, including selecting collateral types, sourcing collateral via the Yield Aggregator, and determining buyback aggressiveness.
* **Automation via Transfer Hooks**: Once the process is validated, buybacks will be automated during Ubiquity Dollar transactions, enhancing efficiency and scalability.

## **Ubiquity Ecosystem**

The Ubiquity ecosystem is designed with a modular approach, enabling individual products to function independently while benefiting from **synergies across products**. This ensures that the ecosystem's value grows as more products are integrated.

### **Current Components**

1. **Ubiquity Dollar Protocol**: The foundation of the ecosystem, built around the stability and utility of the UUSD stablecoin.
2. **Yield Aggregator**: A tool to optimize returns, which also plays a key role in collateral sourcing for the Ubiquity Dollar.

### **Shared Ecosystem Elements**

*   **üè¶ Treasury**:

    Acts as the financial backbone, supporting collateral buybacks and funding ecosystem development. Enables sustainable growth and facilitates the transition to partial collateralization.
*   **üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Governance**:

    Oversees decision-making across the ecosystem, transitioning from centralized to community-driven governance in structured phases.

### **Future Products**

The ecosystem is designed to support multiple products, each operating autonomously but benefitting from shared resources such as governance and treasury, creating synergies across the ecosystem.

The **Ubiquity Dollar Protocol** and its supporting ecosystem components are the first steps in building a scalable and resilient platform, demonstrating the potential of hybrid stablecoins in a decentralized financial ecosystem.
