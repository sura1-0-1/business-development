Issued as virtual prepaid cards, they are compatible with Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, ensuring ease of use in both digital and physical retail environments.

## **Key Features**

### **1, Prepaid Cards:**

These cards are issued as virtual prepaid cards that can be easily integrated with Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, facilitating seamless transactions in both digital and physical retail environments. Users can spend up to $1,000 without the need for Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, making the cards more accessible and appealing to new users who prioritize privacy or have limited access to traditional banking.

Particularly suitable for privacy-focused cryptocurrency users and unbanked individuals around the world, providing them with a reliable financial tool.

### **2, Debit Cards (Planned):**

These future debit cards will offer automatic funding from earnings generated through UbiquityOS, providing a convenient and seamless spending experience. Development will require adherence to advanced regulatory requirements and will involve increased operational costs to ensure compliance with financial regulations.

### **3, Future Lending Market:**

There is a potential plan to integrate a lending protocol, such as a fork of Aave, which would enable lending and borrowing activities within the Ubiquity ecosystem. Users will have the ability to secure real-world credit using Ubiquity governance tokens and uUSD as collateral, adding practical utility to their digital assets.
