# Protocol Treasury

## Overview

The **Treasury** Module serves as the financial backbone of the Ubiquity ecosystem. Its primary objectives are to fund both the development of new products and the enhancement of existing ones. Additionally, it acts as a stabilizing force for the ecosystem by deploying its assets effectively.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Funding Mechanism**

The treasury is responsible for supporting the ecosystemâ€™s growth and stability by allocating resources to improve and enhance existing products and financing the creation of innovative solutions to expand the ecosystem.

### **2. Revenue Contribution**

Every product in the Ubiquity ecosystem contributes to replenishing the treasury. A percentage of all **seigniorage** (newly minted UUSD tokens) flows into the treasury.

### **3. Capital Deployment**

Funds in the treasury are not left idle but are actively utilized to support ecosystem stability to enhance liquidity for the **Ubiquity Dollar (UUSD)** during its early phases. As new products launch, funds are reallocated to optimize returns and reinforce ecosystem products.
