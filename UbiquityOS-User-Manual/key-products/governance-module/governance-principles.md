# Governance Principles

The governance framework is anchored by three key principles that guide its structure and operations.

### **1, Stability Focus:**

The primary aim of the governance system is to prioritize ecosystem stability through phased decentralization. This approach ensures that as the ecosystem evolves, it does so in a manner that minimizes disruption while allowing for gradual, sustainable growth. By taking deliberate steps towards decentralization, the governance model seeks to build resilience within the community and its operations, safeguarding against potential risks and ensuring long-term viability.

### **2, Community-Centric:** 

A foundational aspect of the governance process is its commitment to being community-centric. Stakeholders are actively engaged at every stage, from proposal development to decision-making, ensuring that the governance initiatives reflect the collective aspirations and values of the community. This inclusive approach promotes transparency, fosters trust, and aligns efforts with the broader goals of the ecosystem, reinforcing the notion that governance is a collaborative endeavor.

### **3., Accountability and Incentives:** 

The governance mechanisms are closely tied to the health and success of the Ubiquity ecosystem, establishing a framework for accountability and incentives. Developers and decision-makers are held responsible for their actions, as their performance directly impacts the community and ecosystem's well-being. This alignment of interests not only incentivizes active participation and responsible governance but also ensures that the development efforts are in harmony with the long-term success of the ecosystem.

Together, these principles create a robust governance model that emphasizes stability, community engagement, and accountability, fostering an environment where all stakeholders can thrive and contribute to the ecosystem's overall success.
