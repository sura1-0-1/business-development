### Welcome to the **DevPool Onboarding Guide**

### **Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Account**

The first step is to set up your GitHub account and link it to [DevPool](https://devpool.directory/). To get started, log in to the [DevPool directory](https://devpool.directory/) using your GitHub credentials. Once inside, follow the prompts to register by entering your GitHub username and password. After providing this information, you'll be asked to approve access by authorizing the Ubiquity bot to connect to your GitHub account.&#x20;

Once registration is complete, youâ€™re officially part of [**DevPool**](https://devpool.directory/) and can start exploring opportunities.

### **Step 2: Explore Available Tasks**

With your account set up, itâ€™s time to dive into the task board, where you can explore available tasks tailored to your skills and interests. Browse through opportunities and review detailed information about each task, including specific requirements, deadlines, priority levels, and rewards. To refine your search, take advantage of sorting options to organize tasks by price, time, priority, or recent activity.

Once you find a task that aligns with your skills, youâ€™re ready to jump in!

### **Step 3: Select and Start Your Task**

Now that you've identified a task, itâ€™s time to take the next step. Open the task to review it in detail, ensuring itâ€™s a good fit for your skills. Once you're confident, open the associated issue in GitHub and use the `/start` command to assign yourself to the task. By doing so, `ubiquity-os` bot will automatically assign the task to you and mark it under your responsibility. To familiarize yourself with other available commands for managing your task, type `/help`, which will display a complete list of commands and their descriptions.&#x20;

With the task assigned and your tools ready, you can officially start working on it.

***

### **Step 4: Work and Collaborate**

With your task underway, focus on making meaningful progress while tracking your workflow using the available commands. Donâ€™t hesitate to collaborate with other team members or the community to get feedback, share ideas, or discuss challenges.&#x20;

**DevPool** thrives on collaboration, so leverage this opportunity to engage and grow together.

***

### **Step 5: Submit Your Work**

Once youâ€™ve completed your task, itâ€™s time to submit your deliverables for review. Upon approval, your task will be finalized, and you can view your earned rewards.
