* Be specific to get accurate answers.

`/ask How do I set up the development environment?`

**2, /Wallet  Command:**

Register your wallet address before completing any tasks. If this is your first time participating in the DevPool, you will need to register your wallet address to collect payment upon completion of the task.&#x20;

**How to Use:**

* Replace `ubq.eth` with your actual wallet address.

`/wallet mywallet.eth`

This must be done before you complete a task, because of the automatic payment system.



Comment “/wallet 0x0000” but with your address instead, on the issue you are interested to work on to register.
