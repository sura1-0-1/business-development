# Communication Guidelines

The **DevPool Communication Guidelines** are designed to ensure a **productive and respectful environment** for contributors, fostering high-quality interactions and minimizing distractions.

### **Key Rules for Communication**

1.  **Silence is Golden**:

    * Maintain a high **signal-to-noise ratio** in the Telegram group chat. Conversations should remain focused and relevant.
    * GitHub issues and discussions are more forgiving for casual or detailed conversations compared to Telegram.
    * Do **not ask for work** in the DevPool chat. Instead, review open issues on GitHub, self-assign by drafting a pull request, and start contributing.
    * Avoid sending direct messages to core team members on Telegram. Only after completing your first bounty and receiving payment might a core team member initiate direct communication.
    * Avoid using the DevPool chat to promote unrelated jobs or projects. External job offers will be removed.


2.  &#x20;**Partner Program**:

    * Organizations at the seed stage or beyond can inquire about partnerships in the **DAO chat**.


3. **Process and Rule Questions**:
   * Questions about **rules** or the **DevPool Flow** will not be entertained in the DevPool chat.
   * Once started on a task, contributors can ask clarifications on **GitHub**, where core team members are more accommodating.

### **Making a Strong First Impression**

**Introduction Tips**:\
Writing an introduction in the group chat is welcome but should be thoughtful and distinctive.

* Generic messages like:
  * “Professional blockchain developer.”
  * “Talented dev looking for a job.”
* Personalized, relevant introductions like:
  * “gm, Solidity dev here, worked at X before.”

**Stand Out**: Think about what others might have already shared in the chat. If your message isn’t **unique**, it’s best not to send it.

🧠 In conclusion, take a moment to think about what the other candidates before you might have already sent in the group chat.

If what you are about to send IS NOT UNIQUE e.g. “I’m a professional blockchain developer” or “How can I be approved for a bounty?” then it is probably not a good idea to send it in our group chat.
