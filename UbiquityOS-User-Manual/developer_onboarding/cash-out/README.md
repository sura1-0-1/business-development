### **Step 2: Payment Link Generation**

Once the PR is merged and the issue is closed:

* These payment links are sent to each contributor based on the contribution details.

### **Step 3: Access Payment Links**

1. Open the communication platform or tool (e.g., GitHub comment, Notion dashboard) where the payment links are shared.
2. Look for the **bot notification** containing the payment link.
